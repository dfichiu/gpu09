\section*{4.4 Matrix Multiply â€“ CPU sequential version}
a) The Matrix C looks like the following:
0 30 60 90 120 
0 40 80 120 160 
0 50 100 150 200 
0 60 120 180 240 
0 70 140 210 280 
b)
Insert Diagram Time -Size

we can see that the computation time  grows approximately cubic.

c) 
Inser Diagram GLOP/S - Size
The L3 cache has 64MB, we use (4 bytes ) Integer Arrays which means that the critical size should reached around a size of 4000, but we can see in our data that
the GFLOP/S break off at a size approx. 2000, which means that our CPU version may have more overhead than expected.
